<h4>10 Major Comic Storylines That Inspired The DCEU</h4>
The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) has become one of the most successful movie franchises of all-time. It did it through fan-favorite movies, many of them based on iconic moments from comic books. In the DC Extended Universe (DCEU), the movies have been hit or miss, to put it nicely, and much of what has been done on the big screen is original to that format, rather than pulling moments from the comics.
<br>
However, some influences are easy to see in the movies that came directly from a popular DC Comics storyline. Some are obvious, with the Death of Superman as a perfect example, and others are a little more obscure, with simple ideas transferred into a new fresh story.
<h4>Justice League: Origin</h4>
The Justice League movie saw the creation of the most powerful team of superheroes in all of comics. The story itself was based on the DC New 52 tale known as Justice League: Origin, although it technically started in Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice.

The lineup was straight from the New 52 with Cyborg as a member, but it was clearly missing Green Lantern from the movie. Darkseid was the main villain in the comics, and while he pulled the strings, that iconic battle never happened in the movie.
<br>
<h4>The Death Of Superman</h4>
The biggest DC Comics storyline of all-time was a clear influence on Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice, as the movie played out the Death of Superman with tweaks to how the story played out, but with the same outcome. Just like in the comics, Superman and Doomsday fought each other to the death.

This time around, Batman and Wonder Woman were involved, and there was a lot more to the story, but the main gest was that Superman died in his fight with Doomsday, just like in the comics.
<br>
<h4>Joker<h4>
There were many complaints about how Jared Leto portrayed Joker in Suicide Squad, but a lot of it came from the comics. In 2008's Joker by Brian Azzarello and Lee Bermejo, Joker got out of Arkham Asylum and went to a strip club where he killed the owner, with the help of Harley Quinn.

This book painted Joker as a man wanting to rule Gotham City, the same as his portrayal here. Joker and Harley's toxic relationship came straight out of their comic storylines since they first joined forces.
<br>
<h4>The Killing Joke</h4>
The Joaquin Phoenix version in The Joker was influenced by the classic book, The Killing Joke, by Alan Moore. A lot happened in The Killing Joke that had nothing to do with the movie The Joker. However, the influences are there, and they are crystal clear.
In both, Joker is a failed comedian. He is also someone who failed in his relationship goals. In the comics, he had a real wife but lost her in the end. In the movie, it was a woman he was infatuated with, which he never actually had. Instead of going after Commissioner Gordon, Joker in the movie went after Thomas Wayne. Either way, it was easy to see the parallels.
<br>
<h4>Aquaman: The Trench</h4>
The movie Aquaman had an original story, but it paid tribute to the Aquaman from the New 52. The entire attack of the mainland by Orm was straight out of the Throne of Atlantis (2013) storyline from Geoff Johns, Ivan Reis, and Paul Pelletier. T

hat was a huge influence, but there was also Aquaman: The Trench (2011), which was how the New 52 re-introduced Aquaman to the world. That is the comic book line that introduced these cannibalistic ocean-dwelling creatures from the movie.
<br>
<h4>Wonder Woman: Blood</h4>
Wonder Woman was an original story with Diana joining Steve Trevor in World War I to stop the Nazis and save the world. However, the start of the movie was highly influenced by her New 52 re-debut.

In both the movie and the Wonder Woman: Blood comics by Brian Azzarello, Diana lives on Themyscira and has no idea of her past. In the comics, she learns she is of godly descent, and in the movie, she was told her history as well. In both, she leaves the island to find her way in the world.
<br>
<h4>The Dark Knight Returns</h4>
There are many comic book influences, and Easter eggs dropped into Zack Snyder's DCEU movies, and this is true of Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice. There are hints of everything from Superman: Red Son to The Dark Knight Returns when it comes to the Man of Steel and Caped Crusader battling.
The Dark Knight Returns is a true influence, as the Frank Miller book tells the story of an older Bruce Wayne. He has lost Robin, is alone with only Alfred, and has set his sights on a Superman he feels is dangerous. In the movie, he is also older and not as strong as he once was and used armor, the same as in the books.
<br>
<h4>Shazam!: Origins</h4>
Shazam! is based on the New 52 re-introduction of the character. The two stories are so intertwined that DC re-released the story with the movie poster as a cover. This story was told as backup issues in the pages of Justice League when the New 52 began.

It tells the same story as the movie, with Billy Batson becoming Shazam! and turning into a hero for the city. The difference is that Black Adam did not appear in the movie version of the story.
<br>
<h4>Superman: Last Son</h4>
Man of Steel was an origin story for Superman, as it started with him as a kid, learning from his dad that he needed to hide his powers from the public and sacrifice his happiness for the greater good. However, when the story moves to his adult years in Metropolis, this was influenced by a pre-New 52 storyline from 2006-2008 titled Superman: Last Son.

Geoff Johns, Richard Donner, and Adam Kubert told the story of General Zod, Ursa, and Non attacking Earth, and it was the first time they appeared in modern-day DC continuity. This was collected in Action Comics #844-846.
<br>
<h4>Batgirl And The Birds Of Prey</h4>
Batgirl and the Birds of Prey is a very loose influence for the movie Birds of Prey, but it owes a lot to this storyline from DC Rebirth. Barbara Gordon's Oracle basically led the original Birds of Prey, so having the new healthy Batgirl back in the lead was smart for this 2016 series.

In the movie, the lineup is similar, with Harley Quinn replacing Batgirl, teaming with Huntress, Black Canary, and Renee Montoya.

<H4>Iron Man and Beyond: The Marvel Revolution</H4>
It was 2008 when the world first witnessed the start of a cinematic universe. 13 years, 25 movies, and four shows later, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has changed the face of the entire industry.

The journey, however, didn't start in 2008. 1939 is when it all began with the creation of Timely Comics and its first offering, Marvel Comics no. 1, which introduced us to Human Torch and Sub-Mariner.

Avengers: Infinity War was the first time fans across the globe saw their favourite superheroes turn to dust. However, for Marvel, this wasn't the first time they faced such a threat.
<BR>
<H4>The Flight that didn't take off</H4>
It all started with Detective Comics, popularly known as the DC, who launched a comic book featuring...well, Superman! Timely Comics was Martin Goodman's attempt to jump on the comic books bandwagon.

Human Torch, Sub-Mariner, Captain America, and Captain Marvel were some of the first superheroes introduced. They tasted some success here and there but didn't take off. Fast Forward to the 1950s, the comic books bandwagon came to a screeching halt.

Timely Comics turned into Atlas Magazines and focussed on different genres such as like Sci-fi and comedy.
<BR>
<H4>Enters Stan Lee!</H4>
The 1960s marked the turnaround for the company. Atlas Magazines turned into Marvel Comics, and at the helm of it all was the person who changed the way people viewed and perceived superheroes, Stan Lee.

Stan, along with Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko, led the way forward. Lee, however, was the face of Marvel. Spiderman, X-men, Fantastic Four, and Iron Man were just some of the iconic characters created during that time.

What really made them successful was the way these characters were written. They were normal individuals with superpowers. Spiderman worried about his studies and his love life. Tony Stark's mannerisms didn't fit that of an idol superhero. He was cocky and more often than not, did what he thought was right.

They changed the notion that a superhero has got to be perfect, and that was what made them unique and relatable. Going forward, a lot of crossovers began to happen. All these superheroes started to team up and show up in each others' comics. It was the true beginning of the Marvel Universe.
<BR>
<H4>Fall From The Top</H4>
The next few decades saw Marvel turn into a hot property. During that period, the comic book industry saw a new craze. People began to collect comic books in hopes that one day it would be worth a fortune. Be it fans, speculators, media houses or the publishers themselves, each and everyone jumped on the collector's bandwagon.

Marvel and the comic book industry as a whole immensely benefitted from it. Comic books were selling like hotcakes.

Marvel's newfound success attracted many investors, and the company changed hands several times during that period. Marvel Productions opened its first studio in LA in 1981. Five years down the line, New World Pictures acquired Marvel Comics and Marvel Productions. They now called it the Marvel Entertainment Group.

Sometime after, Marvel Comics went to MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings. Now, this is where things started to change. The chief architect of the change was Ronald Perelman.

Under Ronald, Marvel went Public. To expand the company's presence and increase profits, Marvel acquired 46 percent of ToyBiz in 1993. Since the comic book industry was on fire at that point, Perelman decided to hike prices.

But, between 1993-1996 the market turned upside down. People stopped collecting comics, sales dropped and the bubble burst.

Ronald, however, wasn't going to give up. To bring all these comic book characters to life on the big screen, he set up, what is today known as Marvel Studios.

His vision was to buy the remaining part of ToyBiz, but when the shareholders resisted, he filed for bankruptcy. Marvel spent the next few years selling rights of some of its most iconic characters like Spiderman, X-men, Fantastic Four, Iron Man, Thor, and Black Widow to stay afloat.

Balde came out in 1998, The X-men movies started to roll out, and Spiderman came out in 2002. All these movies did well, but for Marvel, this wasn't going to power them up.

And then it happened.

"Why not produce the movies with your characters and under your own banner?", said David Maisel to Marvel.
<BR>
<H4>The Thanos Level Threat</H4>
David Maisel was brought in as the Chief Operating Officer. But producing movies was going to cost a lot of money.

This is when the company took its biggest leap of faith. Marvel cracked a deal with Merrill Lynch. A loan worth $525 million was taken. In return, Marvel put up the rights to Avengers, Ant-man, Nick Fury and other characters at stake if they failed to make that money back.

Marvel did what Captain America would rightly say, "Whatever it takes".
<BR>
<H4>I Am Iron Man</H4>
Marvel now had the money. A deal with Paramount Pictures gave them the rights of Iron Man, Black Widow, and Thor back. Now, in a move that is acknowledged as one of the best decisions by the company, Kevin Feige was promoted as President of Marvel Studios.

In 2019, it took Iron Man's life to stop the biggest threat in the MCU. In 2008, the birth of Iron Man on the big screen saved Marvel.

Iron man did fantastically well at the box office. Robert Downey Jr. was elevated to super-stardom overnight. Tony Stark became a fan favourite character. Everything started to fall in place. In 2009, Disney bought Marvel for $4 billion.

Hulk, Thor, Captain America followed and then came the first big team up on the big screen in 2012, the Avengers. The movie made a whopping 151.9 crore USD.

The story finally changed and everyone could see the turnaround.

From the very first film, Marvel had a different touch. They started placing important scenes in the middle or after the credits rolled. These scenes would raise further interest in the upcoming movies and teased future storylines.

Who can forget Nick Fury showing up after Iron Man and saying, "You think you are the only superhero", or Thanos showing up wearing the infinity gauntlet, saying he'll take care of things himself.

In 2018, Avengers: Infinity War came out and changed the same old ending of heroes coming out on top. Thanos was the big bad, and he won. No cheap tricks or anything. He came, and he dominated.

People weren't used to it. After all, a superhero movie needs to end with the good guys coming out on top. It was a fresh take on how a villain needs to be made big enough.

It worked. Infinity War collected 204.84 crores USD at the box office and is ranked 5th on the list of highest-grossing movies of all time.

Infinity war's ending made headlines around the world. The craze for Marvel's next film, Avengers: Endgame, reached monstrous proportions.

As expected, the movie came out and broke records like it was nothing. It is currently placed 2nd on the list of highest-grossing movies of all time.
<BR>
<H4>The Journey Into The Multi - verse</H4>
Marvel is just getting started. With its foray into series through Disney Plus, the universe is expanding at a rapid pace. Wanda-Vision, Falcon and the Winter Soldier fared great. Loki introduced us to the multi-verse. What-if is exploring possibilities that we never thought of a few years back.

With Marvel, we are heading into the multi-verse. With Spiderman: No Way Home, we may see Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield as spidermen of their respective universe team up with Tom Holland's Spiderman. If that happens, it will arguably be the biggest on-screen collaboration ever.

The company just released Shang-chi a few weeks back, and despite the pandemic, the movie is doing extremely well a the box office.

With a host of movies and shows like Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, Thor: Love and Thunder, Hawkeye, Eternals, and Spider-Man: No Way Home in the pipeline, the interest in Marvel productions has never been higher.

Marvel was always destined to make its own movies. As Frigga would say, "Everyone fails at who they're supposed to be. The measure of a person, of a hero, is how well they succeed at being who they are".
<BR>
<H4>MCU MOVIE LIST</H4>
Kevin Feige has produced every film in the series, alongside Avi Arad for the first two releases, Gale Anne Hurd for The Incredible Hulk, Amy Pascal for the Spider-Man films, Stephen Broussard for Ant-Man and the Wasp, Jonathan Schwartz for Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, Nate Moore for Eternals, and Brad Winderbaum for Thor: Love and Thunder.

Many of the actors, including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, and Jeremy Renner signed contracts to star in numerous films.

Marvel Studios releases its films in groups called "Phases".[1][2] Its first film is Iron Man (2008), which was distributed by Paramount Pictures. Paramount also distributed Iron Man 2 (2010), Thor (2011), and Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), while Universal Pictures distributed The Incredible Hulk (2008).

<H4>Future<H4>
At any given time, Marvel Studios has future films planned five-to-six years out from what they have announced.[93] By April 2014, additional storylines were planned through 2028,[94] resulting in many planned films that were intentionally "completely different" from the films in The Infinity Saga.[19] Disney has scheduled additional release dates for unannounced Marvel Studios films on November 3, 2023,[78] as well as February 16, May 3, July 26, and November 8, 2024.[95] Marvel Studios is also working on an unknown project with Scarlett Johansson, who will serve as a producer,[96] as well as planning at least three more Spider-Man films starring Tom Holland with Sony Pictures.
<BR>
<H4>BLADE</H4>
By May 2013, Marvel Studios had a working script for a new Blade film after regaining the rights following New Line Cinema's prior film series.[98][99] In February 2019, Mahershala Ali approached Marvel Studios about starring in a new film after previously portraying Cornell "Cottonmouth" Stokes in Marvel Television's Luke Cage.[100] Kevin Feige officially announced the film with Ali in the title role at the July 2019 San Diego Comic-Con;[100][20] Ali first had an uncredited voice cameo as Blade in Eternals (2021).[101] In February 2021, Stacy Osei-Kuffour was hired to write the film.[102] Bassam Tariq had been hired to direct by September 2021.[103][104] Filming is expected to begin in July 2022,[105] at Trilith Studios[106][better source needed] in Atlanta, Georgia.[107] Blade will be released in a future MCU phase.[108]
<BR>
<H4>Untitled Deadpool Film</H4>
After the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney was announced in December 2017, Disney CEO Bob Iger said Ryan Reynolds would reprise his role as Wade Wilson / Deadpool from 20th Century Fox's R-rated X-Men films Deadpool (2016) and Deadpool 2 (2018) in the PG-13 rated MCU.[109][110] By December 2019, Reynolds confirmed a third Deadpool film was in development at Marvel Studios,[111] with Wendy Molyneux and Lizzie Molyneux-Logelin writing the film by November 2020,[112] when Reynolds' involvement and the film's R-rating were confirmed.[112][113] In January 2021, Feige confirmed the film's MCU setting.[113] Filming is expected to begin in 2022.[114]
